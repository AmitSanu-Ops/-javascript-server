FEATURES Of VS-Code
1. Debugging - One of the key features of Visual Studio Code is its great debugging support. VS Code's built-in debugger helps accelerate your edit, compile and debug loop.

2. Basic Editing - Visual Studio Code is an editor first and foremost, and includes the features you need for highly productive source code editing. This topic takes you through the basics of the editor and helps you get moving with your code.


3. Intelligent Code Completion - IntelliSense is a general term for a variety of code editing features including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists. IntelliSense features are sometimes called by other names such as "code completion", "content assist", and "code hinting."

4. Snippets - Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.
In Visual Studio Code, snippets appear in IntelliSense (Ctrl+Space) mixed with other suggestions, as well as in a dedicated snippet picker (Insert Snippet in the Command Palette). There is also support for tab-completion: Enable it with "editor.tabCompletion": "on", type a snippet prefix (trigger text), and press Tab to insert a snippet.
The snippet syntax follows the TextMate snippet syntax with the exceptions of 'interpolated shell code' and the use of \u; both are not supported.

5. Robust and Extensible Architecture - Architecturally, Visual Studio Code combines the best of web, native, and language-specific technologies. Using Electron, VS Code combines web technologies such as JavaScript and Node.js with the speed and flexibility of native apps. VS Code uses a newer, faster version of the same industrial-strength HTML-based editor that has powered the “Monaco” cloud editor, Internet Explorer's F12 Tools, and other projects. Additionally, VS Code uses a tools service architecture that enables it to integrate with many of the same technologies that power Visual Studio, including Roslyn for .NET, TypeScript, the Visual Studio debugging engine, and more.
Visual Studio Code includes a public extensibility model that lets developers build and use extensions, and richly customize their edit-build-debug experience.
