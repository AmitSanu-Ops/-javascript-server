                                                        MERN-STACK
MERN Stack is a JavaScript Stack which is used for easier and faster development of full-stack web applications.
MERN Stack Comprises of 4 technologies:
1. MongoDB
2. EXpress
3. React
4. Node.js
Each of these 4 ground-breaking technologies gives a start to finish structure for the developer to work in and each of these technologies have a major impact in the development of web applications.

                                                         1. MongoDB
 MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. In simple words, you can say that - Mongo DB is a document-oriented database. It is an open source product, developed and supported by a company named 10gen.
Purpose of building MongoDB -
All the modern applications require big data, fast features development, flexible deployment, and the older database systems not competent enough, so the MongoDB was needed.
The primary purpose of building MongoDB is:
1. Scalability
2. Performance
3. High Availability
4. Scaling from single server deployments to large, complex multi-site architectures.
5. Key points of MongoDB
6. Develop Faster
7. Deploy Easier
8. Scale Bigger
MongoDB is a document oriented database. It is a key feature of MongoDB. It offers a document oriented storage. It is very simple you can program it easily.
MongoDB stores data as documents, so it is known as document-oriented database.Storing data in this manner is called as document-oriented database.
Mongo DB falls into a class of databases that calls Document Oriented Databases. There is also a broad category of database known as No SQL Databases.

Features of MongoDB:
1. Support ad hoc queries
In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.

2. Indexing
You can index any field in a document.

3. Replication
MongoDB supports Master Slave replication.
A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)

4. Duplication of data
MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.

5. Load balancing
It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.

6. Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.

7. Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.

8. It is a schema-less database written in C++.

9. Provides high performance.

10. Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.

11. Easy to administer in the case of failures.

12. It also supports:
JSON data model with dynamic schemas
Auto-sharding for horizontal scalability
Built in replication for high availability
Now a day many companies using MongoDB to create new types of applications, improve performance and availability.





                                               2. Express
ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends. With ExpressJS, you need not worry about low level protocols, processes, etc.

Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications. It provides us the tools that are required to build our app. It is flexible as there are numerous modules available on npm, which can be directly plugged into Express.

Express was developed by TJ Holowaychuk and is maintained by the Node.js foundation and numerous open source contributors.


                                                3. React
ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components. According to React official documentation, following is the definition −

React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

React Features

1. JSX − JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended.
2. Components − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.
3. Unidirectional data flow and Flux − React implements one-way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.
4. License − React is licensed under the Facebook Inc. Documentation is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

React Advantages

1. Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
2. Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.
3. Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps

React Limitations

1. Covers only the view layer of the app, hence you still need to choose other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development.
2. Uses inline templating and JSX, which might seem awkward to some developers.


                                               4. Node.js

                            Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Features of Node.js

1. Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.
2. Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.
3. Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.
4. No Buffering − Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

License − Node.js is released under the MIT license.

Where to Use Node.js?
1. I/O bound Applications
2. Data Streaming Applications
3. Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)
4. JSON APIs based Applications
5. Single Page Applications
